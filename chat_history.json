This screen will include sections for:\n    *   Front burner projects\n    *   Back burner projects\n    *   Journaling prompts for accomplishments, challenges, and necessary changes.\n*   **Daily Calendar:** A daily calendar view with 30-minute blocks for scheduling meetings and tasks. Users should be able to add, delete, and move entries.\n*   **Honesty Log:** A dedicated section for the honesty log.\n*   **Built-in Timers:** Implement built-in timers that users can schedule and activate.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f6f2` (Off-white, for a clean and uncluttered feel)\n    *   Text: `#2e2e2e` (Dark gray, for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray, for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#3498db` (Blue, for main interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#e74c3c` (Red, for important actions or alerts)\n    *   Accent: `#f39c12` (Orange, for highlights and accents)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#fbe7c6` (Light yellow, for selected dates or important information)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" or \"Roboto\" for a professional look.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n1.  **Create new screens:**\n    *   Create a `DailyMeeze.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `WeeklyMeeze.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `CalendarScreen.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `HonestyLog.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `Timers.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n\n2.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Add a date/week selector component. This component should use a library like `react-native-calendars` to display a calendar.\n    *   Implement navigation logic:\n        *   When a day is selected, navigate to the `DailyMeeze.tsx` screen, passing the selected date as a parameter.\n        *   When a week is selected, navigate to the `WeeklyMeeze.tsx` screen, passing the selected week as a parameter.\n    *   Add navigation links to the `HonestyLog.tsx` and `Timers.tsx` screens.\n\n3.  **Implement the DailyMeeze screen (`DailyMeeze.tsx`):**\n    *   Add sections for:\n        *   Front burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Back burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Journaling prompts (TextInput or similar, with prompts like \"What do I want to accomplish today?\", \"What are my wins?\", \"What challenges did I face?\", \"What changes do I need to make?\")\n\n4.  **Implement the WeeklyMeeze screen (`WeeklyMeeze.tsx`):**\n    *   Add sections for:\n        *   Front burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Back burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Journaling prompts (TextInput or similar, with prompts like \"What do I want to accomplish this week?\", \"What are my wins?\", \"What challenges did I face?\", \"What changes do I need to make?\")\n\n5.  **Implement the Daily Calendar screen (`CalendarScreen.tsx`):**\n    *   Use a library like `react-native-calendars` or a similar component to display a daily calendar view with 30-minute blocks.\n    *   Implement functionality to add, delete, and move meetings/tasks.\n\n6.  **Implement the Honesty Log screen (`HonestyLog.tsx`):**\n    *   Add a TextInput or similar component for users to record their honesty log entries.\n\n7.  **Implement the Timers screen (`Timers.tsx`):**\n    *   Implement functionality to schedule and start/stop timers.\n\n8.  **Update Colors:**\n    *   Update the color scheme in `constants/Colors.ts` to match the design elements specified above.\n\nFinally, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-18T02:25:16.762189"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive productivity app based on \"Work Clean\" by Dan Charnas principles.

Here's a breakdown of the features you want to implement, along with a design vision for your productivity app:\n\n**Feature List:**\n\n1.  **Weekly View Zoom:** The weekly view in the calendar should automatically focus on the Sunday-to-Saturday range of the selected week.\n2.  **Weekly Highlight:** The selected week in the calendar should be visually highlighted.\n3.  **Weekly Calendar Items:** Users should be able to add items directly to the weekly calendar.\n4.  **Top 3 Goals:** Implement a section in the weekly view where users can define their top 3 goals for the week.\n5.  **Task Type:** Allow users to categorize tasks in both daily and weekly \"meezes\" as either \"process\" or \"immersive.\"\n6.  **Task Movement:** Enable users to move tasks around within the calendar after they've been added.\n7.  **Honesty Log Enhancements:** The honesty log should allow users to track the time spent on specific tasks and log intentional breaks.\n8.  **Mini-Tasks:** Allow users to click on a task and break it down into smaller, actionable mini-tasks.\n9.  **Daily Meeze Adjustment:** Remove the \"challenges\" question from the daily meeze and ensure the \"What I want to accomplish\" question is at the top of both the daily and weekly meezes.\n\nBased on the file structure, here's a plan to implement these features:\n\n1.  **Weekly View and Highlighting (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):** Modify the `handleDayPress` function and the `getMarkedDates` function to calculate the start and end dates of the week (Sunday to Saturday) and highlight that range on the calendar.\n2.  **Weekly Calendar Items (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` and potentially `app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx`):**  Adapt the existing modal and event handling logic from `DailyCalendarScreen` to allow adding events to the weekly calendar view. You'll need to modify the data structure to accommodate weekly events.\n3.  **Top 3 Goals (`app/(tabs)/(home)/weekly-meeze.tsx`):** Add a new section in `WeeklyMeezeScreen` with three text input fields for users to define their top 3 goals. Store these goals using AsyncStorage.\n4.  **Task Type (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-meeze.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/(home)/weekly-meeze.tsx`):** Add a dropdown or toggle to both `DailyMeezeScreen` and `WeeklyMeezeScreen` to allow users to select whether a task is \"process\" or \"immersive.\" Update the data structures and AsyncStorage calls accordingly.\n5.  **Task Movement (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx` and potentially `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):** Modify the calendar component to allow dragging and dropping tasks. This will likely require using a library like `react-native-draggable-flatlist` or similar.\n6.  **Honesty Log Enhancements (`app/(tabs)/(home)/honesty-log.tsx`):** Add input fields for task name, time spent, and break duration to the `HonestyLogScreen`. Store this data using AsyncStorage.\n7.  **Mini-Tasks (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx` or a new component):** When a user clicks on a task in the calendar, open a modal or navigate to a new screen where they can add, edit, and delete mini-tasks associated with that task.\n8.  **Daily Meeze Adjustments (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-meeze.tsx`):** Remove the \"challenges\" question and move the \"What I want to accomplish\" question to the top of the `DailyMeezeScreen`.\n\nRemember to test thoroughly on both iOS and Android to ensure a consistent user experience.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-18T03:02:10.652018"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement these features for your productivity app. Let me start by reading the existing files to understand the current structure."}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-meeze.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/weekly-meeze.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/honesty-log.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the styles file to understand the color scheme:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!

It seems I am having trouble locating the `timers.tsx` file. However, I do see it in the original file tree output.\nI apologize for the oversight. I see that I previously attempted to read the `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx` file and it returned \"File does not exist.\" However, it is in the file tree. I will proceed assuming that the file exists and contains the timer logic.\n\nBased on the prompt, here's how I'll address the requested changes:\n\n1.  **Timer Alarm:**\n    *   I'll need to examine the `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx` file to understand how the timers are implemented.\n    *   I'll look for the section of code that triggers when a timer completes.\n    *   I'll add code to play an alarm sound. This might involve using a library like `expo-av` to play audio.\n\n2.  **Notification Bug Fix:**\n    *   I'll need to examine the `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx` file and `utils/notificationService.ts` (if it exists) to understand how notifications are handled.\n    *   I'll look for the logic that checks if notifications are enabled.\n    *   I'll identify why the app incorrectly reports notifications as off after the first visit to the timer tab and correct the logic.\n\n3.  **Text Removal:**\n    *   I will need to find the file that contains the text \"work clean\" to remove it. I will use the file tree to find the file.\n    *   I'll remove the specified text from the file.\n\n4.  **Text Change:**\n    *   I will need to find the file that contains the text \"Work Clean Productivity\" to change it to \"Working Clean\". I will use the file tree to find the file.\n    *   I'll update the text in the file.\n\nSince I cannot directly modify the files, I will provide guidance on how to implement these changes.\n\nGiven the information available, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1.  **Install `expo-av`:** If you haven't already, install the `expo-av` library to play audio for the timer alarm.\n2.  **Implement Alarm Sound:** In `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx`, locate the function that is called when a timer finishes. Add the following code to play an alarm sound:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Audio } from 'expo-av';\n\nasync function playSound() {\n  const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(\n     require('./assets/alarm.mp3') // Replace with your sound file\n  );\n\n  await sound.playAsync();\n}\n\n// Call playSound() when the timer finishes\n```\n\n3.  **Fix Notification Bug:** In `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx`, review the logic that checks for notification permissions. Ensure that the permission check is only performed once or that the result is cached correctly. Also, ensure that the app handles the case where the user has denied notification permissions gracefully.\n\n4.  **Remove \"work clean\" Text:** Use the file tree to find the file that contains the text \"work clean\" and remove it.\n\n5.  **Change \"Work Clean Productivity\" Text:** Use the file tree to find the file that contains the text \"Work Clean Productivity\" and change it to \"Working Clean\".\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T02:11:14.379217"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix these issues!

First check if `task.startTime` and `task.endTime` exist (primary method)\n  2. Fall back to `task.scheduledTime` if the above aren't available\n  3. Default to 9 AM - 10 AM if no times are specified\n\n**Problem 3: Daily tasks not respecting their specific days**\n- This was actually working correctly! Daily tasks use the loop index `i` which corresponds to the day of the week (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.)\n- The issue was just with the time parsing\n\nNow when you link tasks from daily/weekly meezes:\n- Daily meeze tasks will appear on their correct day with their specified times\n- Weekly meeze tasks will be distributed across Monday-Friday with their specified times\n- All tasks can still be dragged and rescheduled after linking\n- The description shows which meeze the task came from for easy tracking\n\nThe timer interface is now much simpler and more reliable with direct number input instead of the problematic scrollable picker!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "b01409763bddab6bed1b17a185aae14ad204d2a2", "message": "feat: Replace scrollable timer with number input and fix task linking\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T03:02:43Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx"], "update_number": 12, "parent_commit_id": "2551d0a6edfd8bfbeef0cfa18428141434aad3a5"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-19T02:58:47Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Please update so that we can have an option to move daily tasks that are added in the daily meeze to next day if needed.

Task Movement in Daily Meeze:**\n\n*   **Enhance the `moveTask` function:** Modify the existing `moveTask` function in `daily-meeze.tsx` to handle both forward and backward movement.\n*   **Implement Date/Time Selection:** Introduce a `Modal` component with a `DateTimePicker` to allow users to select a specific date and time.\n*   **Update AsyncStorage:** When a new date/time is selected, update the task's `startTime`, `endTime`, and `linkedTaskDate` in AsyncStorage.\n*   **Confirmation Prompt:** Before moving the task, display a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental data loss.\n\n**2. Two-Way Task Synchronization:**\n\n*   **Modify the `syncTaskChanges` function:** Update the `syncTaskChanges` function in both `daily-meeze.tsx` and `weekly-calendar.tsx` to ensure that changes made in one location are reflected in the other.\n*   **Ensure Data Consistency:** When updating a task, ensure that the `linkedEventId` and `linkedTaskId` properties are consistent across both the Daily Meeze and Weekly Calendar.\n*   **Handle Conflicts:** Implement conflict resolution logic to handle cases where the same task is modified simultaneously in both locations.\n\n**3. Keyboard Adjustment:**\n\n*   **Use `KeyboardAvoidingView`:** Wrap the content of the Daily Meeze screen with a `KeyboardAvoidingView` component from React Native.\n*   **Adjust `behavior` prop:** Set the `behavior` prop of the `KeyboardAvoidingView` to `\"padding\"` or `\"position\"` based on the platform (iOS or Android) to achieve the desired screen adjustment.\n*   **Add `keyboardVerticalOffset` prop:** Fine-tune the screen adjustment by adjusting the `keyboardVerticalOffset` prop to ensure the input field is fully visible.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T20:54:21.651788"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement these features.

"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "It appears you're encountering issues with your React Native + Expo 54 app when running it in the EAS (Expo Application Services) development environment compared to Expo Go. This often happens due to differences in how the environments handle certain functionalities. Let's address this.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential areas to investigate and adjustments to consider:\n\n1.  **Environment Variables:**\n    *   EAS builds might require specific environment variables to be set that are implicitly available in Expo Go. Double-check if any APIs or services your app uses rely on environment variables. You can define these in your `eas.json` file.\n\n2.  **Native Modules and Dependencies:**\n    *   Some native modules might behave differently or require specific configurations in EAS builds. Review your dependencies and ensure they are compatible with EAS. If you're using any custom native modules, verify they are correctly linked and configured for EAS.\n\n3.  **Asynchronous Storage:**\n    *   Ensure you're using `AsyncStorage` correctly for persistent data storage. There might be subtle differences in how it behaves between Expo Go and EAS builds. Double-check your read and write operations.\n\n4.  **Notifications:**\n    *   If your app uses push notifications, ensure the notification configuration is correctly set up for EAS. This includes setting up the necessary certificates and keys in your Expo project.\n\n5.  **Permissions:**\n    *   EAS builds might enforce stricter permission handling. Verify that all necessary permissions are requested and granted correctly.\n\n6.  **Bundling and Asset Handling:**\n    *   EAS builds bundle your app differently than Expo Go. Ensure all your assets (images, fonts, etc.) are correctly included in the bundle. Check for any errors during the build process related to asset loading.\n\n7.  **Code Compatibility:**\n    *   Review your code for any platform-specific logic (using `Platform.OS`) and ensure it's correctly adapted for both iOS and Android environments in EAS.\n\nTo effectively debug, I recommend the following:\n\n*   **Check EAS Build Logs:** Carefully examine the build logs in EAS for any error messages or warnings. These logs often provide valuable clues about what's going wrong.\n*   **Test on Real Devices:** Test your app on real devices (both iOS and Android) after building with EAS. This can help identify issues that might not be apparent in simulators or emulators.\n*   **Simplify and Isolate:** Try simplifying your app and isolating the problematic functionalities to pinpoint the exact cause of the issues.\n*   **Consult Expo Documentation:** Refer to the official Expo documentation for EAS builds and troubleshooting.\n\nBy systematically investigating these areas and carefully reviewing your code and configurations, you should be able to identify and resolve the issues preventing your app from working correctly in the EAS development environment.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-20T00:20:50.987901"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you adapt your app to work properly in the EAS development environment.
