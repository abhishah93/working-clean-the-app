This screen will include sections for:\n    *   Front burner projects\n    *   Back burner projects\n    *   Journaling prompts for accomplishments, challenges, and necessary changes.\n*   **Daily Calendar:** A daily calendar view with 30-minute blocks for scheduling meetings and tasks. Users should be able to add, delete, and move entries.\n*   **Honesty Log:** A dedicated section for the honesty log.\n*   **Built-in Timers:** Implement built-in timers that users can schedule and activate.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f6f2` (Off-white, for a clean and uncluttered feel)\n    *   Text: `#2e2e2e` (Dark gray, for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray, for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#3498db` (Blue, for main interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#e74c3c` (Red, for important actions or alerts)\n    *   Accent: `#f39c12` (Orange, for highlights and accents)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#fbe7c6` (Light yellow, for selected dates or important information)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" or \"Roboto\" for a professional look.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n1.  **Create new screens:**\n    *   Create a `DailyMeeze.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `WeeklyMeeze.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `CalendarScreen.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `HonestyLog.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `Timers.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n\n2.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Add a date/week selector component. This component should use a library like `react-native-calendars` to display a calendar.\n    *   Implement navigation logic:\n        *   When a day is selected, navigate to the `DailyMeeze.tsx` screen, passing the selected date as a parameter.\n        *   When a week is selected, navigate to the `WeeklyMeeze.tsx` screen, passing the selected week as a parameter.\n    *   Add navigation links to the `HonestyLog.tsx` and `Timers.tsx` screens.\n\n3.  **Implement the DailyMeeze screen (`DailyMeeze.tsx`):**\n    *   Add sections for:\n        *   Front burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Back burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Journaling prompts (TextInput or similar, with prompts like \"What do I want to accomplish today?\", \"What are my wins?\", \"What challenges did I face?\", \"What changes do I need to make?\")\n\n4.  **Implement the WeeklyMeeze screen (`WeeklyMeeze.tsx`):**\n    *   Add sections for:\n        *   Front burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Back burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Journaling prompts (TextInput or similar, with prompts like \"What do I want to accomplish this week?\", \"What are my wins?\", \"What challenges did I face?\", \"What changes do I need to make?\")\n\n5.  **Implement the Daily Calendar screen (`CalendarScreen.tsx`):**\n    *   Use a library like `react-native-calendars` or a similar component to display a daily calendar view with 30-minute blocks.\n    *   Implement functionality to add, delete, and move meetings/tasks.\n\n6.  **Implement the Honesty Log screen (`HonestyLog.tsx`):**\n    *   Add a TextInput or similar component for users to record their honesty log entries.\n\n7.  **Implement the Timers screen (`Timers.tsx`):**\n    *   Implement functionality to schedule and start/stop timers.\n\n8.  **Update Colors:**\n    *   Update the color scheme in `constants/Colors.ts` to match the design elements specified above.\n\nFinally, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-18T02:25:16.762189"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive productivity app based on \"Work Clean\" by Dan Charnas principles.

Here's a breakdown of the features you want to implement, along with a design vision for your productivity app:\n\n**Feature List:**\n\n1.  **Weekly View Zoom:** The weekly view in the calendar should automatically focus on the Sunday-to-Saturday range of the selected week.\n2.  **Weekly Highlight:** The selected week in the calendar should be visually highlighted.\n3.  **Weekly Calendar Items:** Users should be able to add items directly to the weekly calendar.\n4.  **Top 3 Goals:** Implement a section in the weekly view where users can define their top 3 goals for the week.\n5.  **Task Type:** Allow users to categorize tasks in both daily and weekly \"meezes\" as either \"process\" or \"immersive.\"\n6.  **Task Movement:** Enable users to move tasks around within the calendar after they've been added.\n7.  **Honesty Log Enhancements:** The honesty log should allow users to track the time spent on specific tasks and log intentional breaks.\n8.  **Mini-Tasks:** Allow users to click on a task and break it down into smaller, actionable mini-tasks.\n9.  **Daily Meeze Adjustment:** Remove the \"challenges\" question from the daily meeze and ensure the \"What I want to accomplish\" question is at the top of both the daily and weekly meezes.\n\nBased on the file structure, here's a plan to implement these features:\n\n1.  **Weekly View and Highlighting (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):** Modify the `handleDayPress` function and the `getMarkedDates` function to calculate the start and end dates of the week (Sunday to Saturday) and highlight that range on the calendar.\n2.  **Weekly Calendar Items (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` and potentially `app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx`):**  Adapt the existing modal and event handling logic from `DailyCalendarScreen` to allow adding events to the weekly calendar view. You'll need to modify the data structure to accommodate weekly events.\n3.  **Top 3 Goals (`app/(tabs)/(home)/weekly-meeze.tsx`):** Add a new section in `WeeklyMeezeScreen` with three text input fields for users to define their top 3 goals. Store these goals using AsyncStorage.\n4.  **Task Type (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-meeze.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/(home)/weekly-meeze.tsx`):** Add a dropdown or toggle to both `DailyMeezeScreen` and `WeeklyMeezeScreen` to allow users to select whether a task is \"process\" or \"immersive.\" Update the data structures and AsyncStorage calls accordingly.\n5.  **Task Movement (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx` and potentially `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):** Modify the calendar component to allow dragging and dropping tasks. This will likely require using a library like `react-native-draggable-flatlist` or similar.\n6.  **Honesty Log Enhancements (`app/(tabs)/(home)/honesty-log.tsx`):** Add input fields for task name, time spent, and break duration to the `HonestyLogScreen`. Store this data using AsyncStorage.\n7.  **Mini-Tasks (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx` or a new component):** When a user clicks on a task in the calendar, open a modal or navigate to a new screen where they can add, edit, and delete mini-tasks associated with that task.\n8.  **Daily Meeze Adjustments (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-meeze.tsx`):** Remove the \"challenges\" question and move the \"What I want to accomplish\" question to the top of the `DailyMeezeScreen`.\n\nRemember to test thoroughly on both iOS and Android to ensure a consistent user experience.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-18T03:02:10.652018"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement these features for your productivity app. Let me start by reading the existing files to understand the current structure."}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-meeze.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/weekly-meeze.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/honesty-log.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the styles file to understand the color scheme:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!
