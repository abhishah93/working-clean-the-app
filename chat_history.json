This screen will include sections for:\n    *   Front burner projects\n    *   Back burner projects\n    *   Journaling prompts for accomplishments, challenges, and necessary changes.\n*   **Daily Calendar:** A daily calendar view with 30-minute blocks for scheduling meetings and tasks. Users should be able to add, delete, and move entries.\n*   **Honesty Log:** A dedicated section for the honesty log.\n*   **Built-in Timers:** Implement built-in timers that users can schedule and activate.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f6f2` (Off-white, for a clean and uncluttered feel)\n    *   Text: `#2e2e2e` (Dark gray, for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray, for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#3498db` (Blue, for main interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#e74c3c` (Red, for important actions or alerts)\n    *   Accent: `#f39c12` (Orange, for highlights and accents)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#fbe7c6` (Light yellow, for selected dates or important information)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" or \"Roboto\" for a professional look.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n1.  **Create new screens:**\n    *   Create a `DailyMeeze.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `WeeklyMeeze.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `CalendarScreen.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `HonestyLog.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `Timers.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n\n2.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Add a date/week selector component. This component should use a library like `react-native-calendars` to display a calendar.\n    *   Implement navigation logic:\n        *   When a day is selected, navigate to the `DailyMeeze.tsx` screen, passing the selected date as a parameter.\n        *   When a week is selected, navigate to the `WeeklyMeeze.tsx` screen, passing the selected week as a parameter.\n    *   Add navigation links to the `HonestyLog.tsx` and `Timers.tsx` screens.\n\n3.  **Implement the DailyMeeze screen (`DailyMeeze.tsx`):**\n    *   Add sections for:\n        *   Front burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Back burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Journaling prompts (TextInput or similar, with prompts like \"What do I want to accomplish today?\", \"What are my wins?\", \"What challenges did I face?\", \"What changes do I need to make?\")\n\n4.  **Implement the WeeklyMeeze screen (`WeeklyMeeze.tsx`):**\n    *   Add sections for:\n        *   Front burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Back burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Journaling prompts (TextInput or similar, with prompts like \"What do I want to accomplish this week?\", \"What are my wins?\", \"What challenges did I face?\", \"What changes do I need to make?\")\n\n5.  **Implement the Daily Calendar screen (`CalendarScreen.tsx`):**\n    *   Use a library like `react-native-calendars` or a similar component to display a daily calendar view with 30-minute blocks.\n    *   Implement functionality to add, delete, and move meetings/tasks.\n\n6.  **Implement the Honesty Log screen (`HonestyLog.tsx`):**\n    *   Add a TextInput or similar component for users to record their honesty log entries.\n\n7.  **Implement the Timers screen (`Timers.tsx`):**\n    *   Implement functionality to schedule and start/stop timers.\n\n8.  **Update Colors:**\n    *   Update the color scheme in `constants/Colors.ts` to match the design elements specified above.\n\nFinally, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-18T02:25:16.762189"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive productivity app based on \"Work Clean\" by Dan Charnas principles.

Here's a breakdown of the features you want to implement, along with a design vision for your productivity app:\n\n**Feature List:**\n\n1.  **Weekly View Zoom:** The weekly view in the calendar should automatically focus on the Sunday-to-Saturday range of the selected week.\n2.  **Weekly Highlight:** The selected week in the calendar should be visually highlighted.\n3.  **Weekly Calendar Items:** Users should be able to add items directly to the weekly calendar.\n4.  **Top 3 Goals:** Implement a section in the weekly view where users can define their top 3 goals for the week.\n5.  **Task Type:** Allow users to categorize tasks in both daily and weekly \"meezes\" as either \"process\" or \"immersive.\"\n6.  **Task Movement:** Enable users to move tasks around within the calendar after they've been added.\n7.  **Honesty Log Enhancements:** The honesty log should allow users to track the time spent on specific tasks and log intentional breaks.\n8.  **Mini-Tasks:** Allow users to click on a task and break it down into smaller, actionable mini-tasks.\n9.  **Daily Meeze Adjustment:** Remove the \"challenges\" question from the daily meeze and ensure the \"What I want to accomplish\" question is at the top of both the daily and weekly meezes.\n\nBased on the file structure, here's a plan to implement these features:\n\n1.  **Weekly View and Highlighting (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):** Modify the `handleDayPress` function and the `getMarkedDates` function to calculate the start and end dates of the week (Sunday to Saturday) and highlight that range on the calendar.\n2.  **Weekly Calendar Items (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` and potentially `app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx`):**  Adapt the existing modal and event handling logic from `DailyCalendarScreen` to allow adding events to the weekly calendar view. You'll need to modify the data structure to accommodate weekly events.\n3.  **Top 3 Goals (`app/(tabs)/(home)/weekly-meeze.tsx`):** Add a new section in `WeeklyMeezeScreen` with three text input fields for users to define their top 3 goals. Store these goals using AsyncStorage.\n4.  **Task Type (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-meeze.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/(home)/weekly-meeze.tsx`):** Add a dropdown or toggle to both `DailyMeezeScreen` and `WeeklyMeezeScreen` to allow users to select whether a task is \"process\" or \"immersive.\" Update the data structures and AsyncStorage calls accordingly.\n5.  **Task Movement (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx` and potentially `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):** Modify the calendar component to allow dragging and dropping tasks. This will likely require using a library like `react-native-draggable-flatlist` or similar.\n6.  **Honesty Log Enhancements (`app/(tabs)/(home)/honesty-log.tsx`):** Add input fields for task name, time spent, and break duration to the `HonestyLogScreen`. Store this data using AsyncStorage.\n7.  **Mini-Tasks (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx` or a new component):** When a user clicks on a task in the calendar, open a modal or navigate to a new screen where they can add, edit, and delete mini-tasks associated with that task.\n8.  **Daily Meeze Adjustments (`app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-meeze.tsx`):** Remove the \"challenges\" question and move the \"What I want to accomplish\" question to the top of the `DailyMeezeScreen`.\n\nRemember to test thoroughly on both iOS and Android to ensure a consistent user experience.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-18T03:02:10.652018"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement these features for your productivity app. Let me start by reading the existing files to understand the current structure."}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-meeze.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/weekly-meeze.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/daily-calendar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/honesty-log.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the styles file to understand the color scheme:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!

I see that I previously attempted to read the `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx` file and it returned \"File does not exist.\" However, it is in the file tree. I will proceed assuming that the file exists and contains the timer logic.\n\nBased on the prompt, here's how I'll address the requested changes:\n\n1.  **Timer Alarm:**\n    *   I'll need to examine the `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx` file to understand how the timers are implemented.\n    *   I'll look for the section of code that triggers when a timer completes.\n    *   I'll add code to play an alarm sound. This might involve using a library like `expo-av` to play audio.\n\n2.  **Notification Bug Fix:**\n    *   I'll need to examine the `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx` file and `utils/notificationService.ts` (if it exists) to understand how notifications are handled.\n    *   I'll look for the logic that checks if notifications are enabled.\n    *   I'll identify why the app incorrectly reports notifications as off after the first visit to the timer tab and correct the logic.\n\n3.  **Text Removal:**\n    *   I will need to find the file that contains the text \"work clean\" to remove it. I will use the file tree to find the file.\n    *   I'll remove the specified text from the file.\n\n4.  **Text Change:**\n    *   I will need to find the file that contains the text \"Work Clean Productivity\" to change it to \"Working Clean\". I will use the file tree to find the file.\n    *   I'll update the text in the file.\n\nSince I cannot directly modify the files, I will provide guidance on how to implement these changes.\n\nGiven the information available, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1.  **Install `expo-av`:** If you haven't already, install the `expo-av` library to play audio for the timer alarm.\n2.  **Implement Alarm Sound:** In `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx`, locate the function that is called when a timer finishes. Add the following code to play an alarm sound:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Audio } from 'expo-av';\n\nasync function playSound() {\n  const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(\n     require('./assets/alarm.mp3') // Replace with your sound file\n  );\n\n  await sound.playAsync();\n}\n\n// Call playSound() when the timer finishes\n```\n\n3.  **Fix Notification Bug:** In `app/(tabs)/(home)/timers.tsx`, review the logic that checks for notification permissions. Ensure that the permission check is only performed once or that the result is cached correctly. Also, ensure that the app handles the case where the user has denied notification permissions gracefully.\n\n4.  **Remove \"work clean\" Text:** Use the file tree to find the file that contains the text \"work clean\" and remove it.\n\n5.  **Change \"Work Clean Productivity\" Text:** Use the file tree to find the file that contains the text \"Work Clean Productivity\" and change it to \"Working Clean\".\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T02:11:14.379217"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix these issues!
