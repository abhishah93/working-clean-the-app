"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will design a productivity app based on the principles of \"Work Clean\" by Dan Charnas, focusing on front/back burner project management, journaling prompts, a daily calendar, and built-in timers.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Date/Week Selector:** Implement a date/week selector on the home screen that opens a calendar view.\n*   **Daily/Weekly Meeze:** Based on the date/week selection, navigate the user to a daily or weekly \"Meeze\" screen. This screen will include sections for:\n    *   Front burner projects\n    *   Back burner projects\n    *   Journaling prompts for accomplishments, challenges, and necessary changes.\n*   **Daily Calendar:** A daily calendar view with 30-minute blocks for scheduling meetings and tasks. Users should be able to add, delete, and move entries.\n*   **Honesty Log:** A dedicated section for the honesty log.\n*   **Built-in Timers:** Implement built-in timers that users can schedule and activate.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f6f2` (Off-white, for a clean and uncluttered feel)\n    *   Text: `#2e2e2e` (Dark gray, for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray, for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#3498db` (Blue, for main interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#e74c3c` (Red, for important actions or alerts)\n    *   Accent: `#f39c12` (Orange, for highlights and accents)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#fbe7c6` (Light yellow, for selected dates or important information)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" or \"Roboto\" for a professional look.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n1.  **Create new screens:**\n    *   Create a `DailyMeeze.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `WeeklyMeeze.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `CalendarScreen.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `HonestyLog.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Create a `Timers.tsx` screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n\n2.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Add a date/week selector component. This component should use a library like `react-native-calendars` to display a calendar.\n    *   Implement navigation logic:\n        *   When a day is selected, navigate to the `DailyMeeze.tsx` screen, passing the selected date as a parameter.\n        *   When a week is selected, navigate to the `WeeklyMeeze.tsx` screen, passing the selected week as a parameter.\n    *   Add navigation links to the `HonestyLog.tsx` and `Timers.tsx` screens.\n\n3.  **Implement the DailyMeeze screen (`DailyMeeze.tsx`):**\n    *   Add sections for:\n        *   Front burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Back burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Journaling prompts (TextInput or similar, with prompts like \"What do I want to accomplish today?\", \"What are my wins?\", \"What challenges did I face?\", \"What changes do I need to make?\")\n\n4.  **Implement the WeeklyMeeze screen (`WeeklyMeeze.tsx`):**\n    *   Add sections for:\n        *   Front burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Back burner projects (TextInput or similar)\n        *   Journaling prompts (TextInput or similar, with prompts like \"What do I want to accomplish this week?\", \"What are my wins?\", \"What challenges did I face?\", \"What changes do I need to make?\")\n\n5.  **Implement the Daily Calendar screen (`CalendarScreen.tsx`):**\n    *   Use a library like `react-native-calendars` or a similar component to display a daily calendar view with 30-minute blocks.\n    *   Implement functionality to add, delete, and move meetings/tasks.\n\n6.  **Implement the Honesty Log screen (`HonestyLog.tsx`):**\n    *   Add a TextInput or similar component for users to record their honesty log entries.\n\n7.  **Implement the Timers screen (`Timers.tsx`):**\n    *   Implement functionality to schedule and start/stop timers.\n\n8.  **Update Colors:**\n    *   Update the color scheme in `constants/Colors.ts` to match the design elements specified above.\n\nFinally, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-18T02:25:16.762189"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive productivity app based on \"Work Clean\" by Dan Charnas principles.
